A Full tutorial article can be found at: [Fast Rich Client Rails Development With Webpack and the ES6 Transpiler](http://www.railsonmaui.com/blog/2014/10/02/integrating-webpack-and-the-es6-transpiler-into-an-existing-rails-project/)

Note, this source code repository is going to be ahead of the tutorial. We plan to update the tutorial soon.

# Example Application
This is a simple example application that illustrates the use of ReactJs to implement a commenting
system. Front-end code leverages both ReactJs and Rails asset pipeline while the backend is 100% Rails.
It shows off a little bit of the interactivity of a ReactJs application, allowing the commmenter to
choose the form layout. `react-bootstrap` is used for the React components.

A pure Rails UI generated from scaffolding is shown for comparison.

# Motivation

In no particular order:

- Example of Rails 4.2 with ReactJs with Webpack and ES6.
- Enable development of a JS client independently from Rails using Webpack Hot Module Reload.
- Easily enable use of npm modules with a Rails application.
- Easily enable retrofitting such a JS framework into an existing Rails app.
- Enable the use of the JavaScript ES6 transpiler.

# Technologies involved

See package.json and Gemfile for versions

1. React (for front-end app)
2. React-bootstrap
3. Webpack with hot-reload (for local dev)
4. ES6 transpiler (es6-loader)
5. Rails 4.2 (for backend app)
6. Heroku (for deployment)

# Basic Setup
1. Be sure that you have Node installed. I use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), with node version `v0.10.33`.
1. `git clone git@github.com:justin808/react-webpack-rails-tutorial.git`
1. `cd react-webpack-rails-tutorial`
1. Check that you have Ruby 2.1.5 and the gemset Rails 4.2 (this might change in the future)
1. `bundle install`
1. `npm install`
1. `rake db:setup`
1. `foreman start -f Procfile.dev`
1. Open a browser tab to [http://0.0.0.0:4000]() for the Rail app example.
1. Open a browser tab to [http://0.0.0.0:3000]() for the Hot Module Replacement Example.

# Javascript development without Rails using Hot Module Replacement (HMR)

Setup node and run the node server with file `server.js`.

```
cd webpack
node server.js
```

Point your browser to [http://0.0.0.0:3000]().

Save a change to a JSX file and see it update immediately in the browser! Note,
any browser state still exists, such as what you've typed in the comments box.
That's totally different than [Live Reload](http://livereload.com/) which refreshes
the browser.

# Rails integration

## Build JS/CSS bundles

Run `webpack` to build the JS/CSS bundles and have them saved in the
Rails asset pipeline (app/assets). Although not shown in this tutorial, the
Webpack ExtractTextPlugin can optionally be used to extract the CSS out of
the JS bundle. We've chosen to let Rails handle CSS, SCSS, images, fonts.

```
cd webpack
$(npm bin)/webpack -w --config webpack.rails.config.js
```

`webpack-bundle.js` is generated and saved to `app/assets/javascripts`. This is included in the
Rails asset pipeline.

Observe how the bundles are automatically re-generated whenever your JSX changes.

## Run Rails server

Once the JS bundle has been generated into the Rails asset pipeline, you can start
the Rails server.

```
cd <rails_project_name>
rake db:setup
rails s -p 4000
```

Now point your browser to [http://0.0.0.0:4000]().

Note that it's important to run the Rails server on a different port than the node server.

# Webpack configuration
- `webpack.hot.config.js`: Used by server.js to run the demo HMR server.
- `webpack.rails.config.js`: Used to generate the Rails bundles.
- `webpack.common.config.js`: Common configuration file to minimize code duplication
between the HMR and Rails configurations.

# Bootstrap integration
Notice that Bootstrap Sass is installed as both a gem and an npm package.
When running the Rails app, the bootstrap-sass gem assets are loaded directly
through the asset pipeline without going through Webpack.

See `app/assets/application.css.scss`.

On the other hand when running the Webpack dev server, the bootrap-sass npm
assets are loaded through Webpack (with help of the bootstrap-sass-loader).
See `webpack/webpack.hot.config.js`.

Bootstrap can be customized by hand-picking which modules to load and/or overwriting
some of the Sass variables defined by the framework.

## Bootstrap modules customization

If you are not using all the Bootstrap modules then you'll likely want to customize
it to avoid loading unused assets. This customization is done in separate files
for the Rails app versus the Webpack dev server so it's important to keep these
in-sync as you develop your app in parallel using the Rails and the Webpack HMR
environments.

- Rails Bootstrap customization file: `app/assets/stylesheets/_bootstrap-custom.scss`
- Webpack HMR Bootstrap customization file: `webpack/bootstrap-sass.config.js`

## Bootstrap variables customization

If you need to customize some of the Sass variables defined in Bootstrap you
can do so by overwriting these variables in a separate file and have it loaded
before other Bootstrap modules.

To avoid duplicating this customization between Rails and Webpack HMR,
this custom code has been consolidated under Webpack in
`webpack/assets/stylesheets/_bootstrap-variables-customization.scss` and the
`webpack/assets/stylesheets` directory has been added to the Rails asset pipeline
search path. See config `config/application.rb`. Keep that in mind as you
customize the Bootstrap Sass variables.

# Notes on Rails assets
## Javascript
The `webpack.rails.config.js` file generates webpack-bundle.js which is then included
by the Rails asset pipeline.

## Sass and images
1. The Webpack server loads the images from the **symlink** of the
   `app/assets/images` directory.
2. Since the images are not moved, Rails loads images via the normal asset
   pipeline features.
3. The `image-url` sass helper takes care of mapping the correct directories for
   images. The image directory for the webpack server is configured by this
   line:

```
{ ***REMOVED*** /\.scss$/, loader: "style!css!sass?outputStyle=expanded&imagePath=/assets/images"}
```

## Sass and fonts
The tutorial makes use of a custom font OpenSans-Light. The font files are located
under `app/assets/font` and are loaded by both the Rails asset pipeline and
the Webpack HMR server. See the **symlink** under `webpack/assets/fonts` which
points to `app/assets/fonts`.

Note that the libsass C library, which is used by the Webpack sass-loader, does not
support the font-url() helper so we use url() instead. See the hack in
`webpack/assets/stylesheets/_bootstrap-variables-customization.scss`.

# Process management
Run the following command in your development environment to invoke both Webpack and Rails.
```
bundle exec foreman start -f Procfile.dev
```

# Source Maps
They work for both Rails and the Webpack Server!

# Deploying to Heroku

In order to deploy to heroku, you'll need to run this command once to set a custom
buildpack:

```
heroku config:add BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi.git
```

This runs the two buildpacks in the `.buildpacks` directory.

Also make sure you are running the latest heroku stack, cedar-14, to avoid running
into the [following issue](https://github.com/sass/node-sass/issues/467#issuecomment-61729195).

```
heroku stack:set cedar-14 -a react-webpack-rails-tutorial
```

To deploy the app on Heroku:
```
git push heroku master
```

# Update Node Modules
```
rm npm-shrinkwrap.json
npm-check-updates -u
npm install
npm shrinkwrap
```

Then confirm that the hot reload server and the rails server both work fine. You
may have to delete `node_modules` and `npm-shrinkwrap.json` and then run `npm
shrinkwrap`.
