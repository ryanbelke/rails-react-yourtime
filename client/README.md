ESLint
==========================
The `.eslintrc` file is based on the AirBnb [eslintrc](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/blob/master/linters/.eslintrc).

It also includes many eslint defaults that the AirBnb eslint does not include.

Running linter:
===========================

Soon to be in gulpfile....but gulp-eslint depends on eslint depends on 

```
    "eslint-plugin-react": "^2.0.2",
```

So don't use `npm run gulp lint` yet. 

For now: 

    bin/lint
