## React Native Tutorial
This is a simple mobile app for posting comments in React Native.
This tutorial shows how to connect to the the https://www.reactrails.com API for a sample microblog.

### Setup
1. Install the latest version of Xcode from AppStore or https://developer.apple.com/download/ (Apple ID required)
2. Install the latest version of Android Studio from https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html
3. Install nvm (Node Version Manager)

  ```
  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.32.1/install.sh | bash
  ```

4. Install NodeJS stable

  ```
  nvm install node
  ```

5. Install React Native and recommended packages

  ```
  npm install -g react-native-cli
  brew install watchman
  brew install flow

### Backend API

* Currently connecting by default to https://www.reactrails.com/. Be aware of that!
* The url can be changed app/api/index.js. Keep in mind, that Android emulator is
a separate Virtual Machine with its own localhost binding. To make the api available under emulator,
you have to use ip address of your computer, that could be seen by running `ifconfig` in the shell

### Running IOS
```
react-native run-ios
```

### Running Android
1. Check that installed build tools match gradle config of android project:
  - In gradle config (app > android > build.gradle), search `buildToolsVersion`
  - Run `android sdk` from bash and find installed build tools version there
2. Run emulator from Android studio or `emulator @<version>` from bash (you can find installed version by running `emulator -list-avds` from bash)
3. From project folder run
```
react-native run-android
```
